# Dotfiles
My user software installation and configuration. Vastly inspired by [Andrew Burgess's](https://github.com/andrew8088/dotfiles) one.

Run `./install/bootstrap.sh` to recreate all configuration files.
Run `zsh install/install-all.sh` to run previous command and run all `install.sh` files in the directories.
